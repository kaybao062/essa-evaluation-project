# essa-evaluation-project
The submitted code is part of a project evaluating the impact of ESSA reform on educational outcomes using Difference-in-Differences (DID) analysis. The file output_table.rmd is an RMarkdown document that outlines the procedures for balance checks, linear regression, and generating regression results.

The regressions aim to isolate the impact of the reform by estimating the coefficient of the interaction term (treated * post-reform) on various educational indicators, such as college enrollment rates, ACT scores, and participation and performance in ELA and Math tests.

The main outputs, including the balance check table and regression results, along with their interpretation, are documented in the research paper writing sample.
